# A lower bound for the Barnard–Steinerberger autocorrelation constant

Let C be the smallest constant such that, for every nonnegative f ∈ L¹(ℝ),

    min_{0 ≤ t ≤ 1} ∫ f(x) f(x+t) dx  ≤  C ‖f‖₁².

Barnard and Steinerberger [BS20] proved 0.37 ≤ C ≤ 1/(2(1+θ₀)) ≈ 0.4107675, where θ₀ = −min_x sin(x)/x. In Kravitz's notation [K21], τ = 1/√C. This is also problem 6 of the AlphaEvolve problem list [GGSWT25], which records 0.37 ≤ C ≤ 0.411.

This repository contains a certificate for

    C ≥ 92043155785589760 / 224330199426578281 = 0.41030211724…     (τ ≤ 1.56117)

## The certificate

`certificate.json` describes the step function f = Σᵢ wᵢ · 1[i/K, (i+1)/K):
- K = 3072;
- 3584 nonnegative integer weights wᵢ;
- support [0, 7/6).

## Why the check is exact

For equal-width steps, the autocorrelation t ↦ ∫ f(x)f(x+t) dx is linear between consecutive multiples of 1/K. This is the same computation as in the proof of [K21, Theorem 3.1]. So its minimum over [0, 1] is attained at some t = k/K, where it equals (1/K)·Σᵢ wᵢwᵢ₊ₖ. Since ‖f‖₁ = Σwᵢ / K,

    C  ≥  K · min_{0≤k≤K} Σᵢ wᵢ wᵢ₊ₖ / (Σᵢ wᵢ)²,

and this is a finite computation in integers.

## Verify

Requires Python 3 only; there are no dependencies.

    python3 verify.py certificate.json                  # exact integer/rational check, a few seconds
    python3 check_independent.py certificate.json 40    # second check, see below

`check_independent.py` does not assume the linearity above. It integrates the overlaps of the blocks directly in exact rational arithmetic, both at the claimed minimizer and at random off-grid shifts t ∈ [0, 1]. It checks that nothing falls below the bound.

## Remarks

- **How it was found.** The weights come from numerical optimization (L-BFGS on a soft-min of the correlations, with an upsampling ladder K = 12, 24, …, 3072). A total-variation penalty on the oscillation near the far end of the support then improved the bound slightly and removed the irregular spikes of the raw optimizer output. The certificate stands on its own; how it was found does not matter for its validity.
- **Shape.** The near-optimal functions have:
  - a concentrated block at one end, holding about 40% of the mass;
  - an empty gap;
  - a smooth concave ramp;
  - a smooth rise at distance ≈ 1 from the block.
- **Upper bound.** The Fourier/LP argument of [BS20] cannot give anything below 1/(2(1+θ₀)): the measure v·1_[−1,1] + (1−2v)·δ₀ satisfies all of its constraints. This is essentially [MR20, Thm 4.1].

The search and the verification code were developed with the help of an AI coding assistant (Claude, Anthropic). The certificate was checked independently by the two verifiers above.
